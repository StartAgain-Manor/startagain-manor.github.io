# Chapter 1
Trip Hutchison opened the door to his locker and sighed to himself. Defying all logic, it was 
already somehow the middle of October. In just a week the young corgi would be turning 
eighteen, and in only a few months he would be able to put the hell of high school behind him 
once and for all. He only had to put up with things a little longer. He couldn’t help but wag his tail 
a bit at the thought. 
Trip was taking his chemistry textbook out of his locker when the door unexpectedly slammed 
shut, nearly catching his paw with it. The golden retriever who had inadvertently backed into the 
door turned to apologize. “Oh hey man, sorry about-- oh Drip, it’s *you*. Watch where your locker 
is going, asshole,” the larger canine said with a low growl as he ran his fingers through his 
luxurious locks. The handsome golden, Brandon Scott, made like he was going to shoulder
check Trip, causing the smaller dog to flinch. Satisfied, the retriever flipped up the collar of his 
letterman jacket and gave Trip a smirking salute before leaving.


Trip quickly and angrily spun the dial on his locker’s combination lock and made for the library, 
on alert should the golden retriever reappear unexpectedly. He walked quickly through the halls, 
desperate to retreat to safety. This was Trip’s free period, and he often chose to spend that time 
in the library. It was the one place at Fox Creek High where he could be certain to avoid the 
jocks that constantly harassed him. As he entered the large, well-lit facility, he nodded to the 
demure older emperor penguin who served as the school librarian.


“Good afternoon Drip… er, Trip. Sorry,” Mrs. King the librarian said, a slow look of 
embarrassment spreading across her face. Mrs. King at least made an effort to use Trip’s given 
name, but the old bird was somewhat forgetful and let the pejorative nickname slip out on 
occasion. 


“Like I said before, Mrs. King, Drip is fine. Everyone else calls me that anyway.” The young corgi 
flashed Mrs. King a well-polished if insincere smile as he passed her. He immediately made for 
the back corner table near the reference section, scanning the rest of the room as he walked. 
As usual, the library appeared to be empty. 


Trip quietly took a seat in the chair he favored, letting his bookbag slide down from his shoulder 
to the table before him with a soft thud. *This is all Justin’s fault*, Trip thought to himself for 
something approaching the thousandth time over the years. *Justin Warren. That asshole.*


Trip inserted a pair of cheap earbuds into his ears and queued up some music on his phone. He 
leaned back in the leather-bound wooden chair and closed his eyes, letting the sounds of his 
current favorite punk-pop band *For Another Biscuit* carry him away from his troubles. 


Justin Warren was a black wolf who, at one time, had been Trip’s closest ally in the world. The 
two boys had lived three houses apart since kindergarten, and they had quickly become the 
best of friends over their shared love of video games and dinosaurs. 


In the grand scale of the cosmos, it really hadn’t been that long ago that Trip and Justin had 
been inseparable... right up until early in the fifth grade when Justin had committed the 
*Unforgivable Sin*, ruining everything for Trip. 


Trip had always been a bit small, even by the standards of his breed. “A late bloomer,” his Nana 
had often called him, despite his protests. However, Nana Sanders had been right, Trip *had* 
been a late bloomer. In particular, his bladder had struggled to keep up with the rest of him, and 
like many kids his age Trip had wet the bed all through elementary school.


Justin had known about Trip’s occasional nighttime incontinence issues, and so the wolf had 
known about Trip’s need to wear diapers to bed as a result. After all, the boys knew everything 
about each other, all their deepest secrets and most private thoughts. Never in a million years 
would Justin *ever* tell anyone Trip’s secret... or at least that’s what Trip had always believed. 
Sadly, Justin had made the choice to confide in Luke Merriwether during a whispered late-night 
conversation at a sleepover, and of course the gossipy lynx had shared the juicy secret with all 
his friends the very next morning. By recess the next day, the entire school knew that Trip still 
wore diapers at night. Thus, the cruel and persistent nickname “Drip” had been born.****


It is an incontrovertible fact that there are only three types of children in the world: bullies, 
targets, and everyone else. In Trip’s experience, once you were branded a target by the other 
children you would never be able to escape the designation. Trip had long ago stopped wetting 
the bed at night, but he would never be allowed to forget the shame of it. Even all these years 
later, and just one week before he would be considered legally an adult, he still dealt with daily 
harassment and torment... primarily doled out by the jocks on the school’s champion basketball 
team, the Fox Creek Predators. The Predators had been state champions for two years running, 
thanks in no small part to the exceptional talent and tactical leadership of their team captain and 
all-star point guard, Justin Warren. 


While high school had been a relentlessly challenging experience for Trip, things had gone 
much differently for his arch-nemesis. Justin was bright, handsome, popular among his peers, 
well-liked by the administration and faculty, and beloved by the community of Fox Creek for 
leading the Predators to two consecutive state championships. It was expected that Justin 
would pull off a hat trick by taking the team to their third state victory again this year. National 
recruiters had taken note of the wolf’s rising star, and rumors said he was already being courted 
by some very prestigious universities all over the country. The perfect course of Justin’s life 
seemed to be predestined at this point. Justin was Fox Creek’s own Golden Boy, and all the 
attention he got made Trip sick to his stomach.

attention he got made Trip sick to his stomach.  


*Better enjoy this time in the sun while you can, Justin*, Trip thought to himself. *I’ve been working 
on my plan to take you down for more than a year now, and it’s just about time to get started. *
The corner of Trip’s mouth began to curl involuntarily at the thought. *You have no idea what’s 
about to happen to you, but I hope even your tiny jock brain will be able to appreciate the irony. 
I’m not completely cruel though, I got you the blue diapers instead of the pink ones at least.* The 
corgi giggled aloud at the thought, then quickly opened his eyes to make sure he was still alone. 
He was, of course, but this early into his plan he couldn’t be too careful. Nevertheless, the 
corgi’s eyes sparkled with barely-contained excitement. It was all going to start soon, and then 
everything would finally change for the better.


# Chapter 2

Trip carefully parked his shiny blue car in the driveway and pressed the button on his keyfob to 
lock the car and set its alarm. The car replied with a happy toot, a fact that never failed to bring 
a smile to the young corgi’s face. It had been two weeks since his big eighteenth birthday, and 
he still couldn’t believe Nana had bought him this car. He loved it with all his heart and he swore 
to take impossibly good care of it.


As he walked to the front door of his home he fumbled with his phone, tapping the screen a few 
times and causing the front door to unlock. *Smart homes are so fucking awesome, he thought 
as he entered, bringing the door closed behind himself.*


“Nana, you home?” he called out, expecting no reply as he kicked his shoes off at the door. 
When no answer came, Trip knew that his grandmother was off spending the evening with her 
best friend Brenda again. Nana Sanders was very socially active, and she spent more time 
away from home than even Trip did. Nana was and had always been a real fireball, and Trip 
had learned growing up with her that there was very little in the world capable of slowing her 
down. 
Trip passed through the foyer and turned right in the main hall. He passed the door leading to 
his dad’s old office wordlessly, then passed the great columned entrance to the dining room 
before emerging in the back of the kitchen. The home was relatively dark, since he hadn’t 
thought to turn on the lights through the smart home app while he’d had it open.

“Ziggy, turn on the lights,” he called out into the darkness. Somewhere, a smart speaker gave a 
satisfying *plink!* as lights began turning themselves on throughout the home. The overhead 
lights in the kitchen came on, forcing the young dog to blink for a moment to readjust his eyes. 
He slid his backpack down on the marble countertop and turned to the refrigerator.


After a moment of fishing around, he emerged with a bottle of soda, a half empty pack of 
bologna, and two bananas. *Should hold me until dinner*, he thought with a slight wag. He carried 
his small snack haul into the living room and plopped down on the overstuffed black sofa with a 
grunt and a fair bit of creaking from the leather. 


Trip turned the TV on and began idly scrolling through PawTube to see if any of his favorite 
channels had put up any new videos since yesterday. Not having any luck, Trip gave up and 
pulled up For Another Biscuit’s most recent music video to have something to listen to while he 
munched.


After a few minutes of quiet snacking, Trip turned the TV off and cleaned up after himself, then 
began ambling towards his bedroom. He and Nana had rooms on opposite ends of the 
sprawling house from each other, far too much space for just two people. However, when his 
parents were still alive they had designed the house together with the intent of having a large 
family with lots of pups. Unfortunately they had died in a car accident not long after Trip had 
been born, so he and Nana shared a huge house with nine bedrooms between just the two of 
them. Most of the rooms had been repurposed over the years, which was why Nana had a 
sewing room *and* a completely separate knitting room. 


Trip’s bedroom was further evidence of the unusual configuration of the home. It was actually 
two rooms side-by-side, separated by a foldaway divider wall that Trip left open all the time to 
create a single great bedroom. Even stranger was the closet, a large walk-in affair that opened 
to both halves of the bedroom through separate doors at either end. The whole arrangement 
had been designed to house lots of pups and their clothing as two individual bedrooms with a 
shared adjoining closet. However, since it had just been Trip he had always treated it as a 
single space, though he’d taken much delight as a young puppy to run through the closet and 
out the other side, around and around in endless circles. 


Trip sat his backpack down on his bed and began undressing, removing his purple hoodie and 
hanging it before peeling off his t-shirt and tossing it into the hamper. He slid his sweatpants 
down, carefully sliding his tail back out through the hole before stepping out of them completely. 
He then added his sweats to the growing mound in the hamper. *Gonna need to do laundry 
tonight or tomorrow at the latest,* he thought to himself as he worked to free himself from his 
black boxer briefs in the same manner.  


Once he was fully naked, Trip couldn’t help but check himself out in his dresser mirror. He’d 
always been and still was a bit short, even by corgi standards, but his body had filled out pretty 
well in recent years. As such, while he couldn’t call himself beefy, he definitely had a good tone 
and definition. His orange fur began at the very tips of his ears and ran down his back and sides 
in very fluid lines, while the white fur began at that little spot right between his eyes and ran 
down his muzzle, neck, and most of his chest before ending in a fluffy V-shape just above his 
sheath. From his sheath down past his balls to his inner thighs his fur was a lighter creamsicle 
orange before blending in with the darker tones near his ankles. 


The entire effect was striking, and Trip considered himself pretty good looking for a corgi. Who 
knows, if not for the curse of being forever known as *Drip the Diaper Dog*, Trip might’ve even 
caught some interest from some of the gay boys at school by now.  He twisted and turned in the 
mirror for a few more moments, then gave himself a wag of approval before moving on to his 
closet to retrieve some pajamas. It was early yet, but he wasn’t going anywhere this evening so 
he figured he might as well get comfortable now.


Trip opened the door to his closet and entered, flicking on the light. The closet was truthfully 
large enough to be a proper bedroom of its own, and much of it was empty of clothes. Trip used 
one end as storage for boxes of his old toys, mementos and other keepsakes, although these 
days he was also using it for storage of toys of a very *different* kind.


At the rear of the closet, stacked floor-to-ceiling, were rows of brightly colored boxes marked 
“Crinklewagz: Big Thirsty Diapers For Big Soggy Puppies — Size: Canine Lg Xtra Thick — 1 
Case”. Each case of these diapers contained four bags with sixteen diapers in each bag, or 
sixty-four diapers to a case. Trip had purchased sixteen cases, for a total count of over *one 
thousand diapers.*


The young corgi subconsciously wagged and licked his chops as he walked over to his 
incredible stash. He’d opened only one box, and only one bag from that box. He’d wanted to 
see what the diapers looked like, and oh god, they were so perfect. Trip began to harden a little 
just thinking about it. They were a blue so pale they were almost white, and they had the most 
comically babyish print covering the surface of the diaper, with lots of little pastel interlocking 
paw prints. Even more amusingly, all of the pink paws would fade when wet. The words 
“CRINKLEWAGZ BABY PUP” were printed in much brighter blue across both the front tape 
panel as well as the seat of the diaper in a charming bubble-letter font. These diapers were 
extremely thick to the point of parody, and the plastic shell was very loud and crinkly. The 
overall effect was garish, extremely babyish and silly looking, and left no doubt that these 
weren’t medical devices but rather full on kink gear. In short, they were *exactly* what Trip had 
been after.


The corgi stared at the unfolded diaper lying where he’d left it, fondling his growing red rocket 
idly as his eyes traced its curves. For the briefest of moments, Trip considered trying on the 
brightly colored garment for the full effect, and he even reached out with his free paw to run his 
fingers along the smooth plastic. But the diaper would’ve been much too large for him anyway, 
as he’d purchased these with a much larger wolf in mind.


*Fuck that’s so hot,* Trip thought to himself as he teased his erection. *Big old wolfie, all wrapped 
up in his big, loud, puffy baby diaper that the mean corgi is gonna force him to wear for the 
whole world to see. Justin is going to fucking hate this, and it is going to feel so ***FUCKING*** good.* 


Trip’s eyes briefly cut to a different nearby box, this one open and containing lots of bondage 
gear and accessories including a metal chastity sheath, several anal toys, a pacifier muzzle and 
other implements designed to restrain, control and humiliate. The thought of making his 
nemesis use each of these degrading devices on video for all his friends to see sent a shiver 
down Trip’s back and sent a drop of precum rolling down his shaft and fingers. 


*Asshole, I’m going to make him wish he’d never betrayed me like that*, Trip thought with a 
shudder as he began pawing himself in earnest. *I’m going to ruin him, like he ruined 
me ...ahhhh… and he’s going to beg me, ***BEG*** me to destroy the evidence. He’s going to feel 
fear for the first time in his stupid life ...mmmmh… and then I’m going to show everyone what 
he’s been doing in secret for obviously years now because look how many d-diapers he has, 
and look at all the baby clothes and the toddler toys and ...uhhh… and laugh at the s-s-stupid 
wolf in his big crinkly d-d-diapersohOHMYGODYESUHHHHH….*


Trip arched his back and howled loudly as strand after strand of hot cum fired from the bright 
red tip of his cock. His paw continued jerking rapidly as the young corgi let fly a full load of his 
semen. It sprayed all over his chest in ropy strings, and the closet instantly smelled powerfully of 
it. At last the moment drew to a close, leaving the corgi breathless yet deeply satisfied.


Trip smiled weakly to himself as he stood coated in his own mess. He was definitely going to 
have to work hard tonight to get his closet cleaned up and back in normal order, but shower 
first. *Damn, he thought with a smirk, if this is what just thinking about my plan does to me, I can’t 
wait until this Friday when I actually get to do it. Stupid Justin Warren has no idea what’s coming 
for him.* Trip grinned a blissful, sinister smile at the thought. 


# Chapter 3

Trip grinned to himself; this had been much easier than he expected. He looked down at the 
unconscious wolf lying on his bed, snoring loudly, and chuckled. The guy that had sold him the 
stuff had promised it could take out an elephant, so one black wolf had been no match for the 
tranquilizer. Justin was sure to be unconscious for at least another several hours, plenty of time 
for Trip to put his plan in motion.


The hard part had been getting the larger wolf back to Trip’s place and into his bedroom. 
Thankfully, Nana had been out again, having a Friday night bash with “Brenda and the girls”. 
With much grunting, swearing, and more than a little dragging, Trip had managed to get Justin 
inside and on his bed. Now came the fun part.


Trip began stripping Justin of his clothes, again with much effort. Undressing dead weight was 
proving to be a surprising challenge. But Trip was dedicated, and eventually he had the wolf out 
of his hoodie, t-shirt and jeans. Justin was lying in a heap on Trip’s bed in just a pair of nicely 
filled-out red boxer briefs. “Shame you’re such an asshole,” Trip muttered as he appreciated 
Justin’s nearly naked form. The athletic wolf was muscular without being chunky. His jet-black 
fur was offset with patches of a smoky gray that ran down the front of his body, accentuating his 
musculature beautifully under the right lighting. Justin’s tail was long, thin and tapering, and it 
ended in just the smallest tuft of pure white at the tip.


“Let’s get those undies off, you won’t be needing those for a long, long time,” Trip muttered. Trip 
worked the boxers off Justin’s form, slowly shimmying them down the wolf’s thick legs, at last 
leaving the wolf completely naked. He tossed the boxers onto the pile of the rest of Justin’s 
clothing.


Trip then walked into his closet and returned a moment later holding a box of his supplies. “Let’s 
make this look good for the camera, shall we?” he mused as he unpacked the box on the bed 
next to Justin’s unconscious body. One very, comically thick diaper, baby powder, a relatively 
small butt plug, a chastity cage, a bottle of lube, an oversized baby pacifier, and a snap-crotch 
pastel blue romper covered in teddy bears made their way out of the box one after the other. 
Next Trip worked to get the diaper under the unconscious wolf. It proved to be a great deal more 
work than Trip had expected, but after nearly twenty minutes of stop-and-go work, he managed 
to get the crinkly undergarment lined up roughly where it needed to be. He stepped back and 
took a few pictures with his phone, then sprinkled plenty of powder, stark white against the 
wolf’s black fur. Another few pictures down.


Trip then picked up the chastity cage with a wicked grin on his face. The device was made of 
very shiny metal and it came with several rings of various sizes. Eyeing the sleeping wolf’s 
bulging sack, Trip decided to start with the second largest ring. He worked the ring around 
Justin’s tight sack and sheath, just like he’d practiced on himself countless times before. Once 
the ring was secure, Trip squeezed a bit of lube into his palm and then slowly began stroking 
Justin’s sheath. “I’d be lying if I said this wasn’t kind of hot,” he told the sleeping wolf with a 
smile. Justin, for his part, merely snored.


Once the wolf’s sheath was slick, Trip began slowly working it into the chastity cage. It was 
going to be a very tight fit, but the ring size he chose seemed to be fine. Once everything was 
lined up where it needed to be, Trip snapped the lock closed. “Say goodbye to your little buddy, 
little buddy. You won’t be playing with him for a good while,” Trip said, stifling a giggle. 


Next, Trip picked up the buttplug. It was fairly narrow because Trip was certain Justin had 
probably never had anything up his ass before, and he didn’t want the pain to be enough to 
wake the wolf. Trip lubricated the plug and then ran his slick finger along the entrance to Justin’s 
hole. “God, you’d just die if you knew what was happening to you right now, wouldn’t you?” Trip 
carefully but firmly inserted the tip of the plug into Justin’s slick rosebud, pushing until the device 
was all the way in. The wolf’s cock stirred a bit at the sensation, as much as it could while 
trapped in its steel cage, anyway. Trip wiped the lube from his paws using Justin’s discarded t
shirt, then snapped another few pictures, always making sure to angle the camera to get 
Justin’s face into the shot. 


Trip sprinkled a bit more powder over the chastity cage, then pulled the front of the diaper up 
over Justin’s chastity bulge. The effect made it look a lot like Justin was tenting his diaper. “Oh, 
perfect,” Trip muttered. He taped the top tapes down securely, then did the same with the 
bottom tapes. He carefully rolled the wolf onto his side with a good deal of effort, fastening the 
tail tape snugly over the base of Justin’s tail. Trip stepped back to admire his handiwork. 
The diapers he had chosen fit the large wolf’s form perfectly, and from this angle it looked like 
Justin was rocking a hell of a hardon in that diaper. Of course, it was really just the curve of the 
chastity cage pushing through the diaper, but a casual observer certainly wouldn’t have seen it 
that way. Trip snapped another dozen or so pictures, from many different angles. “Not gonna lie, 
big guy, you do look kinda hot like this. Oh well, you’ll still be embarrassed half to death so I 
guess you might as well look good doing it, hmm?” 


Trip hoisted Justin up and fought the unconscious wolf’s form for a few minutes, dressing him in 
the snap-crotch romper. Getting the shirt part on was challenging enough, but getting the back 
pulled down over the wolf’s extremely diapered ass enough to get the snaps to connect required 
a lot of rocking the wolf back and forth. “Good thing this tranquilizer stuff is working so well,” Trip 
grumbled.  


At last he got the front and back panels on the romper to meet between the wolf’s legs. The 
overall effect was striking, really emphasizing the ridiculously thick diaper bulge between the 
wolf’s legs and making it painfully obvious how juvenile the big muscled jock looked right now. 
After a moment’s rest, Trip slipped the pacifier into the wolf’s muzzle and then took several 
more pictures of the “sleeping angel”, putting his body in various poses for the camera.  


Once he was satisfied that he had enough blackmail evidence to destroy the wolf, Trip then 
went back into the closet and returned with a second box. This one was full of various restraints, 
and Trip thought it would be wise to make certain Justin was well secured before he came to. 
Trip first removed the pacifier from Justin’s mouth and inserted a much larger, bulbous one in its 
place. This one buckled around the back of the wolf’s neck and had another strap that was 
meant to be wrapped around his muzzle to hold it closed around the gag. Trip then slid the 
wolf’s paws into a pair of baby blue leather bondage mittens, rendering the wolf’s claws and 
fingers useless. He attached a pair of matching leather wrist restraints to the wolf’s thick wrists, 
then attached the other end of each to his cast-iron bed frame. He did the same with the black 
wolf’s feet, spreading them apart and attaching them to the footboard. A waist restraint was 
looped around the wolf’s tight waist, then Trip ran it down and under the bed and back up the 
other side, securely attaching the wolf’s middle to the bed.  


At last Trip was satisfied that the wolf was secured. Through it all, Justin never moved and only 
made some small snoring sounds. All that was left to do now was settle in and wait for Justin to 
wake up and meet his fate. 


“I can’t fucking believe this worked,” Trip said to himself quietly, triumphantly. All these months 
of careful planning, of using inheritance money left to him by his parents to order the supplies he 
needed from online sex shops and BDSM boutiques, of working to obtain high-powered animal 
tranquilizer illegally… Trip had been so certain that something would have to go wrong and 
bring his plan to ruin. And yet here Justin was, tightly bound and gagged on Trip’s bed, wearing 
only a butt plug, a chastity cage, and a huge, thick, babyish diaper. 


Trip looked over the results of his handiwork. Justin was trussed up like some sort of giant 
toddler, every part of his body under Trip’s control. Trip could feel himself growing aroused at 
the sight of the formerly intimidating wolf jock lying there looking so powerless and ridiculous in 
his giant baby diaper. *No, won’t do to rub one out right now,* Trip thought. *Later, once all this is 
done, I can look at all the pictures. Oh, speaking of, I need to upload them to the cloud for 
insurance. I’ll do that while I wait for Sleeping Beauty to wake his ass up.*


Trip took a seat at his desk chair and began tapping on his phone, uploading all the pictures 
he’d taken to the cloud. He wanted to have plenty of room free on his phone so he could video 
this next part. The corgi settled in to wait for his prey to awaken, a contented smile spread 
across his face. The wolf would be awakening to a whole new world soon, and Trip couldn’t wait 
to tell him all about it.


# Chapter 4

Justin woke slowly and very groggily. His body felt wrong everywhere. *Didn’t have that much to 
drink last night, did I?* the wolf thought to himself slowly. Everything felt strange; his ass hurt, his 
arms were sore, his dick felt like it was stuffed into his sheath wrong, his balls felt like they were 
being squeezed, even his jaw hurt. *...the hell is going on?*


Justin cracked one eye open, then the other. He was in a totally unfamiliar bedroom, and 
nobody seemed to be around. He moved to get up off the bed but discovered that he was 
unable to move; his arms and legs seemed to be tied down. “Aaaah uhhhhh…” he groaned 
through his gag.  


*Someone is going to fucking die when I find out whose idea of a prank this is,* the wolf thought 
to himself. Then he spotted his clothes lying in a heap in the corner. *The fuck, they stripped me 
too, the perverts?* Whoever had done this to him had at least had the courtesy to cover him up 
to his chest under a blanket.  


Justin sank back into the pillow, eyes drifting closed. His head felt full of rocks and was 
pounding with each heartbeat. If he had to guess, he’d say whoever had abducted him had 
drugged him to do it. *Wonder how long I’ve been here*, the wolf thought to himself. *Dad’ll have 
the entire Fox Creek PD looking for me by now, I’m sure*. With that reassuring thought in mind, 
the wolf dozed back off for a little while as the last of the tranquilizer worked its way out of his 
system. 


“Wakey wakey, eggs and bakey,” a voice spoke, disturbing his slumber. It took a moment, but 
Justin managed to force himself awake. He opened his eyes, but was entirely unprepared to 
see who was standing over him looking down at him. *Trip Hutchison! What in the actual, 
goddamn fuck…? *


“Mhhhhhhphhhhhh!!!” Justin shouted into his pacifier gag, thrashing against his restraints. He 
glared at Trip with hatred in his eyes. 


“Hush now, silly, nobody can hear you,” Trip said to him, smiling. “You’re probably wondering 
what you’re doing all tied up in my bed, aren’t you?” 


“Ahhhhhhhh!!” the wolf moaned, agreeing. *This had better be one damn good explanation, Drip, 
he thought.*


“Well, you see, I found you staggering home from Milo’s house last night in such a state, and I 
offered you a ride home. We came back here, one thing led to another, and you begged me to 
tie you to my bedframe and suck your cock. Was it good for you?” The corgi grinned down at 
Justin innocently.


“Mphhhhh! Mmmm-mmmmphhhhh!” Justin shouted angrily. 



Trip sat down in the desk chair next to the bed. “Not buying that one, are you? Well, okay, the 
truth is, I arranged for this special time together so you and I could have a little chat about how 
you ruined my life, and what you’re going to do to make it up to me.” Trip leaned forward. He 
was surprised to see a strange look flash through Justin’s eyes briefly. Had that been… guilt? 
Trip continued speaking to his captive. 


“Do you remember all those years ago when you told Luke Merriweather that I still wet the bed 
and had to wear diapers at night? And he told everyone, and suddenly the entire fucking town 
made it their mission to make me miserable for the rest of my life? Yeah, this is about that. I 
figured the time was right for me to get revenge on your sorry ass, Justin. You’ve had it too 
good for too long, while I’ve been left to deal with a neverending hell of bullying. You used to be 
my best friend, Justin. I trusted you with everything, and you betrayed that trust. And it ruined 
me. So I’m going to do the same to you. Oh, but let me show you what I mean.” 


Trip reached over and pulled down the blanket covering Justin, revealing his unusual state of 
dress. Justin looked down and saw himself wearing the most babyish-looking, oversized diaper 
he’d ever seen in his life. “Angggghhhh!!” came his muffled shout as he realized what he was 
wearing. 


“That’s right buddy, you look like a big ol’ puppy. So cute in your little diapees.” Trip patted the 
front of the diaper condescendingly, causing it to make a shockingly loud crinkle sound. 
However, the patting revealed that something was wrong with Justin’s sheath. He looked at Trip 
and arched an eyebrow. 


Trip smiled at Justin. “Oh, that? That’s a chastity cage, your bits are all locked up under my 
control now. Just another way to ensure that you stay calm and behave yourself while I explain 
what’s happening. There’s a plug in your ass, too, though I’m sure you’ve noticed that by now. I 
want the big baby to behave and not have a tantrum just yet so we can have a big boy talk.” 
Justin growled a menacing growl, but there really wasn’t anything he could do about his 
situation right now. Though the moment he was freed, he resolved himself to separate Trip’s 
jugular vein from the rest of his body.


Trip smiled again. “Good pup. So let me explain what has happened, and then I’ll untie you after 
we have established a few rules. While you were out, I took some extremely cute and terribly 
compromising pictures of you, which I have uploaded to my cloud for safety. I staged them to 
make it look like you just *loooooove* dressing up like a big baby, like you’ve been doing it for 
years. I even put a bunch of boxes of diapers in the background so it looks like you’ve built up 
quite a stash of baby diapers for yourself. I’ve set those pictures to be emailed to literally 
everyone at Fox Creek High, but as long as I check in with them once a week I can delay that 
from happening. So it’s in your best interest to not get any ideas into your head about jumping 
me.”


The corgi chuckled to himself. “I’ve been planning this for a long, long time, bud. And now I hold 
all the cards. So you are going to listen to me very carefully while I explain what’s going to 
happen next. Nod if you understand what I’m saying to you.” 


Justin forced himself to nod. He was enraged, but he fought to calm himself. If what Trip was 
saying was true, there wasn’t a way out for him right now. Better to let the corgi talk and get 
more information so he could strike when the time was right.


“Good. Now, I’m going to take your pacifier gag out now. We are the only ones here, so 
screaming will do you no good at all. It will, however, righteously piss me off. And you really… 
really don’t want that. Now lift your head so I can get to the buckle.” 


Trip stood next to the bed, and Justin obediently lifted his head so the corgi could remove the 
straps keeping the giant pacifier lodged into his mouth. Once free of the gag, Justin began 
working his sore jaw. “Trip, you really fucked up messing with me, dude.” 


Trip giggled. “Justin, it’s impossible to sound menacing when you’re wearing an enormous baby 
diaper. Don’t even try. Just shut up and listen. I had honestly planned on just sending the 
pictures around and completely ruining you, letting you finally deal with the consequences of 
what you did, but before I do that I want you to explain to me what happened. Why did you tell 
Luke about my bedwetting? You owe me that. You used to be my best friend, I believed in you. 
Why?”


Justin sighed. “It’s… complicated, Trip.” 


Trip scooted closer to the bed. “Well, we’ve got all the time in the world, so you had better start 
talking. Convince me why I shouldn’t totally destroy your life?” 


Justin stared at the ceiling. He’d never wanted to go down this particular road again, but now he 
was being forced. “Luke was staying at my house for the night, we were in my room playing 
video games. He… found one of your diapers. One that I’d nicked from your house. I was 
curious what they felt like and I had taken one of yours home to try, but then I forgot about it and 
Luke found it under my bed. I panicked, I didn’t know what to say, so I told him about you so he 
wouldn’t think I was the bedwetter. It was shitty of me, and I’ve felt awful about it ever since.” 


Trip stared at Justin, incredulous. “You ruined my life, you asshole. The kids never stopped 
teasing me. Fuck, to this day I still get called Drip. DRIP. Because of you. Why didn’t you do 
anything to stop them?”



A tear of shame rolled down Justin’s cheek. “I tried to, Trip. I tried to get them to leave you 
alone, but I was scared too. I’m sorry, man. I really am. What I did to you was awful, and it’s 
been eating away at me for years. I just felt like such a piece of shit.” 


“Bullshit,” Trip said, wiping tears out of his eyes. “Bullshit! You’re just saying what you have to to 
get on my good side. You’ve never felt a fucking thing.” 


“Really?” Justin sighed. “Look under the fur right over my heart. Go on.” He nodded his head 
towards his chest, then looked Trip in the eye.  
“Why?” Trip asked cautiously.


“Just do it, Trip,” Justin replied. “Right above my heart. Look under the fur.” 


Trip stood and pressed a paw to Justin’s chest. He ran his fingers against the fur slowly, just 
above the center-left of Justin’s chest. His eyes grew wide. Beneath the fur, Justin had a small 
tattoo in the shape of a heart, with Trip’s name tattooed in small letters inside it. “Why? What is 
this, Justin?” 


Justin sighed deeply. “I got that a couple years ago. As a reminder to treat others better than I 
treated you. I was in love with you when we were kids. I don’t think I ever stopped being in love 
with you. But I knew that my cowardice had hurt you in a way I could never fix. So this was part 
punishment, and part reminder.” 


Trip sank down into his desk chair in shock. This… had not gone at all how he had expected it 
to. This new revelation was completely unexpected.  


“So what now?” Justin asked him. “Whatever you want to do, you got it. I wronged you hard. 
There’s really just no words that can say how sorry I am. I really am a piece of shit for never 
having made things right. I can’t make it up to you. But… whatever you decide to do, I won’t 
fight you on it. If humiliating me makes you feel better, I’ll roll with it. You want to send out those 
pictures to everyone, I’ll admit it’s all true, back up your story a hundred percent. I just… don’t 
want to live with this guilt anymore. So you tell me what you want, and I’ll do it.” 


Trip’s head was spinning. Suddenly, getting revenge didn’t seem nearly as fun as it had been a 
few minutes ago. “Let me think,” he said sharply.  


Justin stared at Trip’s ceiling, emotionally spent. He’d been holding onto that apology for too 
many years, always convinced that the words would be hollow and meaningless, always talking 
himself out of offering them to Trip. “Can you at least untie me? I’m not going to do anything or 
go anywhere, I promise. I’m at your mercy.” 


Trip sighed and began unbuckling Justin’s restraints. Suddenly, the revenge he’d been so 
eagerly anticipating tasted bitter in his mouth. He’d had no idea Justin had once been in love 
with him, though it certainly explained a few things he’d often wondered about. The fact that 
Justin had confessed to wronging Trip in such a genuine way served to humanize Justin in a 
way Trip hadn’t anticipated. Trip had spent so many years casting Justin as the villain of his 
story that he hadn’t considered that Justin might have grown as a person over that period, and 
now he was forced to decide how to handle this new information. Trip’s brain was whirring. 


Once freed from the restraints, Justin laid back down on Trip’s bed, on his side this time. He 
watched Trip pace back and forth with sad eyes. Occasionally he would glance down at the 
thick diaper he was wearing, but he moved little and said less. 


At last Trip spoke. “Well, you ruined my plans,” he said. “I was going to make you record a 
confession on camera about how you spread rumors about me bedwetting, then I was going to 
send that along with the photos to everyone we know. Except now… no, I guess I’m not doing 
that now.” 


“Then tell me what I can do to make it up to you,” said Justin. “I’ll do anything.” 


“How serious are you about that?” Trip asked cautiously.  


“Extremely. I’ll do anything you say. I just want to make things right between us.” 


“So if, say, I ordered you to replace all your underwear with these diapers from now on, you’d do 
it?” Trip licked his lips hesitantly. 


“If that would make you feel better, yes. I’d do it. I’d keep wearing the chastity cage. I’d become 
your willing sex slave, give you total control over me. I just want to make it right.” Justin nodded 
slowly, sincerity in his eyes. 


“Huh. You’d do that? Submit to me?” Trip could feel his cock begin stirring under his jeans. 


“Yeah. It’s… kind of a thing for me. I like being told what to do by guys who are smaller than me. 
Don’t ask me why,” Justin said. 


Trip looked Justin over. The wolf was extremely handsome, and extremely fit. And having the 
wolf’s cock locked up and only able to be freed at Trip’s whim was an appealing idea. Trip had 
long fantasized about finding a cute sub of his own. And he’d be lying if he said he hadn’t had a 
strong crush of his own on Justin back in the day. “Fine,” he said. “Then from this point forward, 
you can call me ‘sir’. We’ll see where this goes, and in the meantime I won’t do anything with 
the pictures I took. We’ll just keep those as… leverage. If you are obedient and do as I tell you 
to, then I see no reason why those pictures should ever see the light of day. But this is your one 
chance, Justin Warren. If you fuck this up, I swear to god I will send those pictures to everyone 
you’ve ever met. Do you understand me?”

“Yes sir,” Justin replied. “I won’t fuck this up, sir. I’ve wanted a way to make things right with you 
for years, Trip. Er, I mean, sir. I will endure whatever you ask of me, and I’ll prove myself to you, 
sir.” 


“Then, uh… get down here and lick my feet,” Trip said, uncertain. 


The black wolf immediately got off the bed and dropped to his hands and knees, diapered ass 
sticking up comically. He quickly and obediently began licking at the corgi’s toes, moaning a 
little as he did so.  


Trip blinked. “You really are into this stuff, huh?” 


Justin stopped licking. “Yes sir, since I first turned a teenager I’ve jerked off imagining guys 
ordering me around, putting me in bondage, that sort of thing. I even used to tie myself up 
before bed at night, though it was never as good as the real thing.” 


Trip adjusted his rapidly hardening cock. “Have you ever done that kind of thing with another 
guy before?”


“No sir,” came Justin’s response. “I’ve always wanted to, but I’ve… uh, never actually been with 
a guy sir. Or anyone for that matter. I’m a virgin, sir.” 


“Wait, fucking really Justin?” Trip was shocked. If anyone in the history of the world ever exuded 
Big Dick Energy, it was Justin Warren. This new confession was too much.  


“Really, Tri-- er, sir. Never. I didn’t want any of the girls, and my dad would’ve laid a fucking egg 
if I’d ever gotten with any of the boys. So I’m still a virgin, sir. I’m sorry if that displeases you. 
I’ve watched a *lot* of porn on the subject, though. I think I can be a very good sub, sir. I promise 
I’ll try, anyway. And if I displease you, you’ve always got those pictures to ruin my life with, sir.”


Trip turned and sat on the edge of his bed, patting the bed next to him for Justin to sit. “I didn’t 
know that about you. I just assumed you’d had half the ass in Fox Creek High, of both genders. 
I… made a lot of incorrect assumptions about you over the years, and I owe you an apology 
too.”


Justin shook his head. “You don’t owe me an apology, Trip. I’m the one who fucked you over.” 

Trip turned to look Justin straight in the eyes. “You were in fifth grade. We both were. We were 
kids. And I spent so many years hating you that it never once occurred to me that you wouldn’t 
still be the same fifth grader now that you were then. So yeah, I owe you an apology too. 
Doesn’t mean I won’t still take my revenge out of your ass, though I think at this point we’re 
probably both going to enjoy that part. So I think I want to do this a bit differently. Instead of 
forcing you to do something you don’t want to do, I’m going to offer you a choice.” 


“Trip?” Justin asked, one eyebrow arched as he looked down at the corgi. 


“You can take that diaper off, and I’ll let you out of the chastity cage, and you can take that plug 
out. And I’ll let you get dressed and go home. And when you get home, the only copies of those 
pictures I took will be waiting in your inbox. And we’ll never have to speak of any of this again. 
Or there’s the other option.” Trip smiled up at Justin hopefully.


“What’s the other option?” Justin asked trepidatiously. 


“The other option is, you stay in that diaper, your dick stays locked up for *at least* the next three 
days or so with absolutely zero chance of cumming during that time, you spend the night here 
and spend most of that time tied to my bed sucking me off, and *tomorrow* we will discuss how 
you can earn back those pictures *one at a time* with good behavior, pup. That’s the other 
option.” As Trip spoke, he couldn’t help but be pleased to see that Justin was casually trying to 
rub his locked up cock through his diaper. “Your choice, pup.”


Justin swallowed once, hard. “In that case, I’ve chosen. *Sir*.” He dropped to his knees, kneeling 
before Trip and looking up at the corgi hopefully. Trip smiled down at his new pup, immediately 
unbuckling his jeans so he could feed his pup his rock-hard cock. Justin licked his chops 
hungrily and buried Trip’s bone in his muzzle with gusto. 


And that is the story of how Trip Hutchison finally got revenge on Justin Warren. It didn’t work 
out at all like Trip had expected it to, but both boys ended up very happy with the final result.
